# Update 0.5.0 (Stacks & Support)

## Stacking changes
- Saddles, horse armor and music discs now stack to 16.
- Empty minecarts now stack to 4

## GameRules
- added new game rule : nullium.sculkSpread
  - NONE : sculk will not spread
  - VINES : sculk will spread only vines
  - ALL : sculk will spread normally (Default)

## Tag changes
- Added new support block tags :
  - cactus
  - nether warts
  - nylium plants
What these tags do is let you place the block on top of the block in tag instead of having a hardcoded list of things.

- Changed existing support block tags :
  - cane_support -> support/cane
  - wither_rose_placeable -> support/wither_rose
